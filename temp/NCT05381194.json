        "The objective of this study is to analyze the efficacy of a new regimen using Bedaquiline,\r\n      Pretomanid, and Linezolid for 26 weeks (6 months) for the treatment of FQ-resistant MDR-TB\r\n      through the clinical trial. The recently completed Zenix trial observed that lower doses\r\n      and/or shorter durations of linezolid than 1200mg for 6 months appear to have high efficacy\r\n      and improved safety. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to analyze the\r\n      effectiveness and safety of the BPaL regimen including modified dosing of linezolid for the\r\n      patients with fluoroquinolone-resistant MDR-TB."
