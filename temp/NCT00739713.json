        "The objective is to study the effect of sea buckthorn oil on dry eye.",
        "The objective is to study whether regular consumption of sea buckthorn berry oil can relieve\r\n      the symptoms of dry eye syndrome. The study design is a parallel randomized double-blind\r\n      placebo controlled trial. The participants daily consume sea buckthorn or placebo oil for 3\r\n      months. The dry eye symptoms will be monitored during the study using a validated\r\n      questionnaire. In addition clinical dry eye tests are made by an ophthalmologist three time\r\n      during the study. Samples will be taken for tear film lipid and cytokine analyses. Blood\r\n      samples for the analyses of inflammatory markers are also obtained. The cytokine and other\r\n      inflammation marker analyses are optional. The symptoms will be monitored and clinical tests\r\n      made also 4 weeks after the participants have stopped consuming the study oils."
