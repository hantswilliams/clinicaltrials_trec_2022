        "This study employs a repeated measures experimental design to examine the effect of\r\n      THC-dominant dose of cannabis and CBD-dominant dose of cannabis, relative to placebo, on\r\n      subsequent drinking in an alcohol choice task in which participants choose either to drink or\r\n      receive monetary reinforcement for drinks not consumed. Cannabis will be administered\r\n      simultaneously with an alcohol-priming dose or alcohol placebo.\r\n\r\n      The study will enroll up to 350 nontreatment-seeking heavy episodic alcohol drinkers who use\r\n      cannabis weekly.",
