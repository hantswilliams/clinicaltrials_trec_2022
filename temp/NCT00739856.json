        "ECT was administered using the MECTA-SR1 apparatus. The current amplitude was 800 mA, pulse width was 1.5 ms, and pulse frequency was 50 Hz. Stimulus duration was increased as required to elicit an adequate seizure, defined as at least 25 s with EEG monitoring. The ECT course was fixed, and comprised 6 treatments administered with bitemporal electrode placement at a twice-weekly frequency"
