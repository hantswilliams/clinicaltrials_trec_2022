        "In this study, a new method was proposed to calculate the length of sideburns mini incision\r\n      for zygomatic arch fracture. The purpose of this study was to compare the sideburns mini\r\n      incision calculated by this method with the coronal scalp incision, so as to determine the\r\n      therapeutic effect and advantages of sideburns mini incision calculated by this method.",
        "Eighty patients with zygomatic arch fracture were treated with surgical intervention. Forty\r\n      patients were treated with sideburns mini incision, and the other forty patients were treated\r\n      with coronal scalp incision. Data such as incision length, operation time and postoperative\r\n      complications were recorded. The follow-up periods were 6 months."
