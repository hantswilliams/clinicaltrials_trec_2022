        "This research study is being done to better understand the effects of kava supplementation on\r\n      sleep quality and salivary cortisol in the context of the acute physical and psychological\r\n      stress of military special forces preparation training. Kava is a botanical dietary\r\n      supplement derived from the plant Piper methysticum. Cortisol is a hormone associated with\r\n      stress.",
        "Acute physical and behavioral stress can interfere with sleep quality and cause cortisol to\r\n      increase. This can have a negative impact on quality of life and the ability to perform\r\n      optimally.\r\n\r\n      Kava, derived from the rootstumps of the Piper methysticum plant, has been utilized\r\n      traditionally, socially, and for its calmative properties by the peoples of Oceania for\r\n      millennia. Kava has been available as a dietary supplement for decades.\r\n\r\n      Participants in this placebo-controlled cross-over study will be enrolled concurrently with a\r\n      special operations prep class during which they will be experiencing significant physical and\r\n      mental stressors. Participants will be divided into two arms - one taking kava and the other\r\n      taking placebo for the first two-week phase of the study. Following a washout and cross-over,\r\n      participants will switch what they are taking for the second two-week phase."
