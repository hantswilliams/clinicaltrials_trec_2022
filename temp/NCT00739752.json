        "The goal of this study is to evaluate two sets of interventions to increase acceptance of\r\n      hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination in patients attending sexually transmitted disease (STD)\r\n      clinics. The 1st set of interventions, with 3 levels, is based on message framing. The 3\r\n      levels are: 1. information only; 2. gain-framed message; and 3. loss-framed message. The 2nd\r\n      set of interventions, with 2 levels, involves how the vaccine is recommended by the health\r\n      care provider. The 2 levels are: 1. HBV vaccine offered; and 2. HBV vaccine recommended. The\r\n      outcome of interest is1st dose acceptance.",
        "The goal of this study is to evaluate two sets of interventions to increase acceptance of\r\n      hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination in patients attending sexually transmitted disease (STD)\r\n      clinics. The 1st specific aim is to assess the effect of message-framing on vaccine\r\n      acceptance. Framing theory suggests that positively framed messages (i.e., benefits of\r\n      getting vaccine) are more effective than negatively framed messages (i.e., dangers of not\r\n      getting vaccine) in stimulating preventive health behaviors. Research on Framing Theory and\r\n      engagement in health behaviors suggests also that the effects may be moderated by other\r\n      attitudinal factors, including perceived risk of the behavior and degree of involvement in\r\n      the message. The 2nd aim is to evaluate the effect of provider-based interventions. Prior\r\n      research suggests that recommendations by health providers are very important in patients'\r\n      decisions regarding acceptance of health care procedures. Patients (18 years and older) will\r\n      be recruited and followed from Chicago and Indianapolis STD clinics during routine medical\r\n      visits. An audio computer-assisted self-interview (A-CASI) will cover demographics, risk\r\n      behaviors, and perceived risk associated with vaccination. Subjects then will be randomized\r\n      to receive a gain-framed, loss-framed, or information only message regarding HBV immunization\r\n      (also delivered by A-CASI). Upon completion of the message-framing intervention, subjects\r\n      will complete additional attitude questions via A-CASI. Upon completion of the A-CASI\r\n      subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two provider intervention conditions: 1. vaccine\r\n      offered or 2. vaccine recommended. For both conditions free HBV immunization will be provided\r\n      by a nurse practitioner. Subsequently, postcard reminders will be sent and phone call\r\n      reminders made for follow-up appointments for those receiving the first and second doses of\r\n      vaccine. The primary outcome measure is HBV vaccination."
