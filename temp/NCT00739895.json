Specifically, they include STIR (edema), early enhancement (inflammation),\r\n      and late enhancement (fibrosis). The presence of 2 of these parameters will indicate the\r\n      presence of myocardial inflammation. Qualitative and quantitative analysis will be performed\r\n      on images obtained from CMR scans, and will be assessed offline using CMR42 (Circle\r\n      International, Calgary) software. Standard methods of assessing edema, inflammation, and\r\n      fibrosis will be implemented. Standard left ventricular function volume analysis techniques\r\n      will be implemented to assess left ventricular dilatation."
