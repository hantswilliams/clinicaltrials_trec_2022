Vedolizumab, a novel biologic agent, is a recombinant humanized\r\n      monoclonal antibody that specifically antagonizes intestine-selective \u03b14\u03b27 integrins on the\r\n      surface of leukocyte subsets, thereby preventing migration of leukocyte subsets from the\r\n      blood to the intestinal mucosa and reducing local inflammation in the gut.
