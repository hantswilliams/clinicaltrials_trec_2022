        "Opioid use disorder (OUD) represents one of the most severe public health crises, with more\r\n      than 2 million individuals affected in the United States. Existing treatments do not target\r\n      and restore several key alterations triggering opioid craving and relapse, including\r\n      increased response to stress, mood disturbances and greater sensitivity to pain, which are\r\n      caused by prolonged exposure to opioids. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled\r\n      study will investigate the effects that palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous molecule\r\n      part of the endocannabinoid system available as a dietary supplement, exerts on these\r\n      alterations and their underlying mechanisms, with the goal of identifying a novel therapeutic\r\n      approach to reduce craving and prevent relapse in patients with OUD."
