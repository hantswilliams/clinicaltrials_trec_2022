Noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners, such as sugar\r\n      alcohols, can be used to replace fermentable carbohydrates in foods, thereby decreasing the\r\n      risk of caries. In order for a sweetener to be labeled as a noncariogenic sweetener, the FDA\r\n      requires that when present in food, the food should not lower the dental plaque pH below 5.7\r\n      either during or up to 30 minutes after consumption.
