        "Working memory (WM) is the ability to hold information actively in mind and is fundamental\r\n      for higher-order cognition. This pilot study aims to (1) evaluate the efficacy of WM training\r\n      in older adults with MCI and (2) understand if and how it works. The study will use\r\n      behavioral and brain imaging assessments to see whether WM training changes how participants\r\n      learn and remember information. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional\r\n      near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) methods will be used. The study will also use cognitive\r\n      tests and questionnaires to determine whether participants' cognitive abilities change with\r\n      training. The study will enroll participants with a diagnosis of MCI as well as cognitively\r\n      intact older adults (healthy controls, HC)."

Participants in the HC group will receive online training (Arm3). Data for HC who received in-person training was already collected (HUM00033133). WM performance in conjunction with brain imaging will be assessed within-subject, twice pre-training (Time1 and Time2) and once post-training (Time3), as well as ~1 month after training (Follow-up). The Time1 vs. Time2 comparison will reveal task-exposure effects, whereas the Time2 vs. Time3 comparison will reveal training effects."
