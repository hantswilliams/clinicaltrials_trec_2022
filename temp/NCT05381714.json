COVID-19 is a multisystem disease and\r\n      therefore presents a variety of symptoms in the acute phase, such as fever, dry cough,\r\n      fatigue, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, shortness of breath, nasal congestion, chest\r\n      pain, muscle or joint pain, headache, and nausea.\r\n\r\n      COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory functions of individuals. Although this situation\r\n      is more difficult in hospitalized patients, it also causes severe effects in individuals who\r\n      recover with home medication. It is thought that this damage caused by COVID-19 may cause\r\n      permanent effects on individuals in the long term. During the COVID-19 period, individuals\r\n      also had to maintain an inactive lifestyle due to quarantine. This decrease in physical\r\n      activity capacity also causes permanent damage to the respiratory functions of individuals.\r\n      In addition, studies have focused on this population, as COVID-19 usually affects older\r\n      individuals. However, considering that young people are also exposed to the COVID-19 virus,\r\n      the effect on respiratory functions in these individuals should also be examined. Combined\r\n      with the available information on pulmonary functions, there is insufficient evidence about\r\n      extrapulmonary features in post-COVID-19 patients who survive mild illness in the long term.\r\n      It is also necessary to examine whether there is permanent damage to extrapulmonary features\r\n      such as peripheral muscle strength in these individuals.\r\n\r\n      Therefore, in our study, it is aimed to examine the long-term results of respiratory\r\n      functions, respiratory muscle strength and peripheral muscle strength of young individuals\r\n      who recovered from COVID-19 and recovered from mild disease."], "overall_status": ["Completed"], "type": ["Actual", "Actual", "Actual", "Actual", "Actual", "Actual"], "start_date": ["January 1, 2022"], "completion_date": ["April 21, 2023"], "primary_completion_date": ["June 1, 2022"], "study_type": ["Observational [Patient Registry]"], "has_expanded_access": ["No"], "observational_model": ["Case-Control"], "time_perspective": ["Cross-Sectional"], "target_duration": ["1 Day"], "measure": ["Respiratory Muscle Strength", "Pulmonary function (Forced vital capacity (FVC))", "Pulmonary function (Forced vital capacity (FEV1))", "Pulmonary function (FEV1 / FVC)", "Pulmonary function (Flow rate 25-75% of forced expiratory volume (FEF 25-75%))", "Pulmonary function (Peak flow rate (PEF))", "Peripheral Muscle Strength", "Peripheral Muscle Strength", "Post-COVID-19 Functional Status", "Shortness of breath", "Fatigue", "Physical Activity"], "time_frame": ["First Day", "First Day", "First Day", "First Day", "First Day", "First Day", "Second Day", "Second Day", "First Day", "First Day", "First Day", "Second Day"], "description": ["Maximal inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength will be evaluated using portable mouth pressure device.", "Pulmonary function will be evaluated with the spirometry.
