Problems such as hypoxia, dyspnea, increased fatigue, decreased exercise\r\n      capacity and respiratory muscle strength occur in COVID-19 patients.In addition,\r\n      abnormalities in skeletal muscles due to systemic inflammation, mechanical ventilation,\r\n      sedation and prolonged bed rest in hospital and intensive care patients cause decreased\r\n      exercise capacity.", "Dyspnea is one of the most common long-term symptoms in COVID-19 patients. It has been\r\n      determined that dyspnea that persists three and six months after hospital discharge is\r\n      associated with peak oxygen consumption in hospitalized and discharged COVID-19 patients,\r\n      while peak oxygen consumption decreases in patients with dyspnea.The effects of inspiratory\r\n      muscle training have been investigated in different lung diseases. In these studies, it was\r\n      reported that inspiratory muscle training increased respiratory muscle strength and\r\n      endurance, exercise capacity and quality of life, and decreased fatigue and dyspnea. In\r\n      addition, it has been found that high-intensity interval aerobic exercise training increases\r\n      exercise capacity in patients with lung disease and heart failure.In heart failure patients,\r\n      it was found that high-intensity interval aerobic exercise training increased peak oxygen\r\n      consumption more than moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise training.Patients need\r\n      exercise training because symptoms such as lung involvement, decreased exercise capacity,\r\n      dyspnea and fatigue continue after the disease in patients who have had COVID-19.\r\n\r\n      The aim of this study is to comparison of the effects of inspiratory muscle training and high\r\n      intensity interval aerobic exercise training in patients with COVID-19.\r\n\r\n      Primary outcome measurement will be oxygen consumption (cardiopulmonary exercise test).\r\n\r\n      Secondary outcome will be muscle oxygenation (Moxy device), physical activity level (multi\r\n      sensor activity device), pulmonary function (spirometer), functional exercise capacity\r\n      (six-minute walk test), respiratory (mouth pressure device) and peripheral muscle (hand-held\r\n      dynamometer) strength, inspiratory muscle endurance (incremental threshold loading test),\r\n      functional status (Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale), dyspnea (London Chest Daily Living\r\n      Activity Scale), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) and quality of life (Saint George\r\n      Respiratory Questionnaire)."], "overall_status": ["Recruiting"], "type": ["Actual", "Anticipated", "Anticipated", "Anticipated", "Actual", "Actual"], "start_date": ["June 5, 2022"], "completion_date": ["August 5, 2024"], "primary_completion_date": ["June 5, 2024"], "phase": [], "study_type": ["Interventional"], "has_expanded_access": ["No"], "allocation": ["Randomized"], "intervention_model": ["Parallel Assignment"], "primary_purpose": ["Supportive Care"], "masking": ["Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)"], "masking_description": ["Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)Triple-blind study; the patients will not be informed about their groups (training group or the control group) and they will be evaluated and trained at different places and times.\r\nEvaluations and interventions will be performed different physiotherapist.
