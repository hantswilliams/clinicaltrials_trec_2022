The study consisted\r\n      of 2 phases: 1. the first year phase lasting until Week 56 and consisting of a randomized,\r\n      double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled portion (NCT00055497) and of a concomitant open label\r\n      (OL) portion, and 2. a long-term extension phase (NCT01070303) that lasted 264 additional\r\n      weeks (Week 56 to Week 320).\r\n\r\n      Potential participants were screened at the time of enrollment in the lead-in, induction\r\n      therapy study (NCT00055523).

Baseline of Study NCT00055497 is\r\n      synonymous with NCT00055523 Week 4.

Participants who demonstrated clinical remission (defined as a Crohn's Disease\r\n      Activity Index [CDAI] score < 150 points) at Baseline of Study NCT00055497 and who remained\r\n      in clinical remission at Week 4 of Study NCT00055497 (those participants constituted the\r\n      randomized analysis set) were randomized to receive 1 of 3 blinded treatments: adalimumab 40\r\n      mg every other week (eow), adalimumab 40 mg every week (ew), or placebo. Participants who did\r\n      not demonstrate clinical remission at Baseline of Study NCT00055497, or who were no longer in\r\n      clinical remission at Week 4 of Study NCT00055497 were assigned to receive OL adalimumab 40\r\n      mg eow; those participants constituted the OL analysis set. At any time during Study\r\n      NCT00055497, participants receiving OL adalimumab 40 mg SC eow who developed a flare or were\r\n      non-responders during OL treatment could have had his/her dose increased to 40 mg SC weekly.\r\n      Participants who were documented as having completed Week 56 are counted in the study\r\n      completion total.\r\n\r\n      After 1 year (Week 56), participants who met eligibility criteria for the long-term extension\r\n      phase (NCT01070303) were switched to OL adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous (SC) eow, and\r\n      participants previously in the OL treatment group of Study NCT00055497 continued on their\r\n      previous OL adalimumab dose (adalimumab 40 mg SC eow or every week)."], "overall_status": ["Completed"], "start_date": ["August 2002"], "type": ["Actual", "Actual", "Actual", "Estimate", "Estimate", "Estimate"], "completion_date": ["December 2008"], "primary_completion_date": ["January 2005"], "phase": ["Phase 3"], "study_type": ["Interventional"], "has_expanded_access": ["No"], "allocation": ["Randomized"], "intervention_model": ["Parallel Assignment"], "primary_purpose": ["Treatment"], "masking": ["Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)"], "measure": ["Number of Randomized Participants Achieving Clinical Remission at Week 56 - Non-Responder Imputation (NRI)", "Number of Randomized Participants Achieving Clinical Remission at Week 56 - Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)", "Number of Participants Achieving Clinical Remission at Week 24 - NRI", "Number of OL Participants Achieving Clinical Remission at Week 56 - NRI", "Number of Participants Achieving Clinical Response 100 (CR-100) - NRI", "Number of Participants Achieving Clinical Response 70 (CR-70)- NRI", "Number of Participants Achieving Clinical Remission at Week 24 - LOCF", "Number of OL Participants Achieving Clinical Remission at Week 56 - LOCF", "Number of Participants Achieving CR-100 - LOCF", "Number of Participants Achieving CR-70 - LOCF", "Change in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) Scores - LOCF"], "time_frame": ["Week 56", "Week 56", "Week 24", "Week 56", "From Baseline of lead-in study to Week 24 and Week 56", "From Baseline of lead-in study to Week 24 and to Week 56", "Week 24", "Week 56", "From Baseline of lead-in study to Week 24 and Week 56", "From Baseline of lead-in study to Week 24 and Week 56", "Change from Baseline of lead-in study to Week 24 and Week 56"], "description": ["Clinical remission is defined as CDAI score <150.
