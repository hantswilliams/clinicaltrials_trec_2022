  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess how healthy premenopausal women respond to different&#xD;
      patterns of sleep loss at different times in the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During a 1.5-week inpatient laboratory protocol, participants will undergo one of two&#xD;
      parallel sleep conditions during either the follicular or luteal phase of the menstrual cycle&#xD;
      (4 study arms total). Subjects will be randomly assigned to each study arm. During their time&#xD;
      in the laboratory, biological samples (e.g., blood) will be collected for assessment of sex&#xD;
      steroid hormones and other analyses. Sleep quantity and quality will be monitored and&#xD;
      responses on neurobehavioral tests and surveys will be monitored for differences across&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

    <measure>PVT mean reaction time</measure>
    <time_frame>The PVT will be administered at frequent intervals over 11 days in a sleep laboratory. Subjects will be in a time-free environment, and not told the sampling frequency.</time_frame>
    <description>The mean reaction time will be calculated across each Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) session. A linear mixed model analysis will be conducted to compare PVT mean reaction time at each time point (multiple points across the study) across all 4 study arms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PVT lapses in attention</measure>
    <time_frame>The PVT will be administered at frequent intervals over 11 days in a sleep laboratory. Subjects will be in a time-free environment, and not told the sampling frequency.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of lapses in attention will be counted across each Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) session. A linear mixed model analysis will be conducted to compare PVT lapses in attention at each time point (multiple points across the study) across all 4 study arms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>KSS score</measure>
    <time_frame>The KSS will be administered at frequent intervals over 11 days in a sleep laboratory. Subjects will be in a time-free environment, and not told the sampling frequency.</time_frame>
    <description>The Karolinska Sleepiness Score (KSS) measures level of sleepiness on a 9-point Likert scale with 1 = Extremely Alert and 9 = Extremely Sleepy. A linear mixed model analysis will be conducted to compare KSS score at each time point (multiple points across the study) across all 4 study arms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>P4/E2 ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Biological samples will be collected at frequent intervals over 11 days in a sleep laboratory. Subjects will be in a time-free environment, and not told the sampling frequency.</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio of progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2) in each sample will be calculated as (P4 ng/ml x 1000)/E2 pg/ml. A linear mixed model analysis will be conducted to compare the P4/E2 ratio at each time point (multiple points across the study) across all 4 study arms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Core body temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>Core body temperature will be collected at frequent intervals over 11 days in a sleep laboratory. Subjects will be in a time-free environment, and not told the sampling frequency.</time_frame>
    <description>Core body temperature is measured via rectal thermistor. A linear mixed model analysis will be conducted to compare the core body temperature at each time point (multiple points across the study) across all 4 study arms.</description>
