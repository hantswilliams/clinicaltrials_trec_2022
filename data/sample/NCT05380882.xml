  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TQB2930 is an anti-HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) bispecific antibody that&#xD;
      can simultaneously bind two epitopes of HER2, leading to a dual HER2 signal blockage. This is&#xD;
      a phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of TQB2930 injection&#xD;
      in subjects with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
