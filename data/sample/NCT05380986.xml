  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to current studies, the combination of camrelizide and apatinib mesylate has&#xD;
      significant efficacy and controllable toxicity in the treatment of solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study adopted camrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate in the treatment of solid&#xD;
      tumors, aiming to further explore the safety of camrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate&#xD;
      in the treatment of solid tumors and provide more research data for the treatment of solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
