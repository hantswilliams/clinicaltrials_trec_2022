  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate acupuncture as a treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder (PTSD) and to correlate the diagnosis of PTSD with Traditional Chinese Medicine&#xD;
      (TCM) diagnostic patterns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate: 1) the TCM diagnostic differentiation patterns of people who have&#xD;
      PTSD as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition; 2) if an acupuncture&#xD;
      treatment approach is acceptable to people with PTSD; and 3) if an acupuncture treatment&#xD;
      approach is associated with a reduction in PTSD symptoms that is comparable to that of&#xD;
      standard treatments. Because symptoms of depression, insomnia, and pain are often associated&#xD;
      with PTSD, we will also evaluate the potential benefit of an acupuncture approach to&#xD;
      depression, insomnia, and pain symptoms in people with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this study will be randomized to one of three groups. Group A will receive&#xD;
      acupuncture therapy. Group B will receive standard Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Group C is a&#xD;
      control group and will receive no treatment. Patients in Groups A and B will undergo a total&#xD;
      of 24 hours of therapy over the 3 month study course. All patients will have five&#xD;
      nontherapeutic study visits; these visits will address diagnosis and assessment. Study visits&#xD;
      will include assessments of PTSD symptoms, sleep symptoms, and level of impairment.&#xD;
