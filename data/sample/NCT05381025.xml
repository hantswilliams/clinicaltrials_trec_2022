  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to better understand the effects of kava supplementation on&#xD;
      sleep quality and salivary cortisol in the context of the acute physical and psychological&#xD;
      stress of military special forces preparation training. Kava is a botanical dietary&#xD;
      supplement derived from the plant Piper methysticum. Cortisol is a hormone associated with&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute physical and behavioral stress can interfere with sleep quality and cause cortisol to&#xD;
      increase. This can have a negative impact on quality of life and the ability to perform&#xD;
      optimally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kava, derived from the rootstumps of the Piper methysticum plant, has been utilized&#xD;
      traditionally, socially, and for its calmative properties by the peoples of Oceania for&#xD;
      millennia. Kava has been available as a dietary supplement for decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this placebo-controlled cross-over study will be enrolled concurrently with a&#xD;
      special operations prep class during which they will be experiencing significant physical and&#xD;
      mental stressors. Participants will be divided into two arms - one taking kava and the other&#xD;
      taking placebo for the first two-week phase of the study. Following a washout and cross-over,&#xD;
      participants will switch what they are taking for the second two-week phase.&#xD;
