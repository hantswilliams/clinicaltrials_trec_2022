    <textblock>
      This study was 8 weeks randomized, double-blind trail to assess the effect of mirtazapine&#xD;
      versus megestrol acetate in treatment of anorexia-cachexia in advanced cancer patients in 80&#xD;
      patients. Participants were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Subject were&#xD;
      randomized to receive either mirtazapine 15 mg tablet daily or megestrol acetate 160 mg&#xD;
      tablet daily for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the measure of FAACT(A/C) score and the&#xD;
      secondary measure includes weight, BMI, quality of life and evaluate adverse effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related cachexia and anorexia (CRCA) comprises one of the most common syndrome of&#xD;
      advanced cancers characterize by anorexia, tissue wasting and loss of body weight accompanied&#xD;
      by a decrease in muscle mass and adipose tissue and by poor performance status that often&#xD;
      precedes death . Death usually occurs when there is a 30% weight loss. The prevalence of CRCA&#xD;
      increases from 50 to 80% before death, and in more than 20% of cancer patients, it is the&#xD;
      cause of death. Cancer-related cachexia and anorexia (CRCA) is associated not only with&#xD;
      impaired quality of life in patients and family members but also with shorter survival. The&#xD;
      management of cancer-related cachexia and anorexia (CRCA) is a great challenge in clinical&#xD;
      practice. To date, practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of CRCA are lacking.&#xD;
      Although megestrol acetate and dexamethasone have shown benefits for CRCA in terms of weight&#xD;
      gain. There is no definitive evidence that these agents improve patient quality of life. This&#xD;
      proposed study is therefore an effort whether there is any role of mirtazapine to improvement&#xD;
      of anorexia in cancer patients. This study will be a randomized, double-blind, clinical&#xD;
      trial. It will be conducted in the department of pharmacology, BSMMU in collaboration with&#xD;
      the department of clinical oncology, BSMMU, NIRCH &amp; Delta Hospital from the day of approval&#xD;
      by the IRB to June, 2022. A total of eighty (80) patients attend in the outpatient department&#xD;
      of clinical oncology, BSMMU, NIRCH &amp; Delta Hospital diagnosed as cancer anorexia will be&#xD;
      selected for the study according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then participants will&#xD;
      randomly be assigned into two intervention groups. The cancer anorexia of each participant&#xD;
      will be assessed by Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy at baseline. The group&#xD;
      A (40) will receive mirtazapine15mg tablet and other group B (40) will receive megestrol&#xD;
      acetate160mg tablet orally once a day for 8 weeks. After 4 and 8 weeks each participant will&#xD;
      be assessed once again by Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy. The quality of&#xD;
      life of CRAC each participant will be assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint will assess the percentage of patients who continue to present anorexia after 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
Anorexia will be defined as the lack of desire to eat, lack of appetite, as measured using the validated version of the Anorexia / Cachexia Scale from the Functional Assessment of Anorexia Cachexia Therapy (FAACT). A score of less than or equal to 24 will be considered diagnostic for anorexia</description>
