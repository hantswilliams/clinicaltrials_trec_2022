  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centre prospective observational cohort study recruiting patients with&#xD;
      5-30mm solid and part-solid pulmonary nodules that have been detected on CT chest scans&#xD;
      performed as part of routine practice. The aim is to determine whether physician decision&#xD;
      making with the AI-based LCP tool, generates clinical and health-economic benefits over the&#xD;
      current standard of care of these patients.&#xD;

        Patients are eligible for the study if all of the following apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are aged 35 years or above&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have baseline CT study with at least one incidentally detected solid or part-solid&#xD;
             pulmonary nodule that:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  is not fully calcified&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is 5-30mm inclusive in maximum axial diameter for the whole lesion measured using&#xD;
                  manual electronic callipers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have baseline CT study that includes at least one series that meets all of the&#xD;
             following (training for this will be provided):&#xD;

               -  Is of a type that meets VNC instructions for use&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Comprises at least one full-inspiration breath-hold scans without a high degree&#xD;
                  of contrast media and does not exhibit quality issues (e.g., motion artefacts)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from the study if any of the following apply:&#xD;

          -  Have thoracic implants that impact the image appearance of the nodule&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have more than five reported pulmonary nodules of any size or type excluding fully&#xD;
