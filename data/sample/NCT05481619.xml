  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease is a group of chronic, non-specific inflammatory diseases of the&#xD;
      intestinal tract whose etiology has not yet been fully elucidated, including ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis and Crohn's disease. Vedolizumab, a novel biologic agent, is a recombinant humanized&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that specifically antagonizes intestine-selective α4β7 integrins on the&#xD;
      surface of leukocyte subsets, thereby preventing migration of leukocyte subsets from the&#xD;
      blood to the intestinal mucosa and reducing local inflammation in the gut. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators propose to build on an existing cohort and analyse, by means of a multi-omics&#xD;
      approach, the baseline gut microbial composition and abundance, intestinal and serum&#xD;
      metabolome characteristics of UC patients and their changes during treatment, to predict the&#xD;
      functional mechanisms by which these changing characteristics influence the therapeutic&#xD;
      response to vindolizumab.&#xD;

      Stool and blood samples etc. were taken from a cohort of patients with ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      treated with Vedolizum at the Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital of&#xD;
      Zhejiang University School of Medicine as well as from a cohort of normal volunteers. Stool&#xD;
      and blood samples from UC patients were analyzed at baseline and at 14, 30, and 52 weeks&#xD;
      after starting treatment. Analysis of changes in gut microbial composition and abundance, gut&#xD;
      and serum metabolome characteristics during 52 weeks of treatment in patients with UC. A&#xD;
      model for predicting the efficacy of vedolizumab treatment by baseline gut microbial&#xD;
      composition and abundance, and gut and serum metabolomic characteristics in patients with&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis was developed in conjunction with clinical information from patients in&#xD;
      the cohort. Based on the model developed, clinical and gut microbial composition and&#xD;
      abundance, gut and serum metabolomics data from other UC patients published in public&#xD;
      databases were combined to confirm the results already found using the UC cohort at our&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
