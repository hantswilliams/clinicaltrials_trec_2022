  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nivolumab is a selective monoclonal antibody that binds to the Programmed cell Death 1 (PD-1)&#xD;
      receptor and causes reduced tumor growth. It is currently approved in France in many&#xD;
      indications. The firsts therapeutics indications validated by the French health authorities&#xD;
      from 2015 - metastatic melanoma2, squamous and non-squamous NSCLC, Kidney cells carcinoma -&#xD;
      were based on clinical trials demonstrating a clinical advantage over standard nivolumab&#xD;
      treatment at a dose of 3mg/kg every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparing the results predicted by simulation based on a pharmacokinetic model with those&#xD;
      obtained in clinical trials, the manufacturer of nivolumab concluded that a fixed dose of 240&#xD;
      mg was equivalent to that calculated based on the weight of the patients, and the European&#xD;
      and then French health authorities have validated this change in clinical practice The&#xD;
      objective of the IMEPOCA study is to assess in real life the economic and clinical impact of&#xD;
      the dose modification of nivolumab that occurred in December 2018 in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the economic efficiency of the change in dose strategy at the national&#xD;
      level, 2 cohorts of patients from the National Health Data System (SNDS), treated for&#xD;
      metastatic cancer and followed up over 1 year will be compared: one having benefited from the&#xD;
      weight-dependent dosage and the other having benefited from the fixed dosage&#xD;
