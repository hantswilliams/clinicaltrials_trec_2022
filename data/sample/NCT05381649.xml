    <textblock>
      Emotionally unstable (borderline) personality disorder (BPD) is characterised by changeable&#xD;
      and extreme emotions and difficulty maintaining relationships. It is often associated with&#xD;
      self-harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empathy has two components; cognitive empathy (imagining someone else's thoughts and&#xD;
      feelings) and emotional empathy (the reciprocal emotional response). People with BPD score&#xD;
      low on cognitive empathy but high on emotional empathy. This suggests that they do not easily&#xD;
      understand other peoples' perspectives, but their own emotions are very sensitive. This is&#xD;
      important because it could align BPD with other neurodiverse conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a computer-based empathy test and short questionnaires to investigate&#xD;
      whether empathy changes during the course of BPD, and if the severity of empathy impairments&#xD;
      correlate with severity. The tests are the multifaceted empathy test (MET) and the&#xD;
      questionnaire of cognitive and affective empathy (QCAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MET requires participants to look at photographs of emotive faces, then choose the most&#xD;
      appropriate adjective. It takes 30 minutes to complete. The QCAE asks 31 questions like 'it&#xD;
      is hard for me to see why some things upset people'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to join the study when they are diagnosed with BPD. Severity&#xD;
      will be measured with the Borderline Symptom List 23, a disability questionnaire, and the&#xD;
      number of self-harming episodes per month, the number of hospital assessments per month and&#xD;
      the number of hospital admissions per month. Short NHS questionnaires of anxiety, depression&#xD;
      and mood will also be completed, along with short reading test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 participants will be assessed 4 times over 2 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) is a mental disorder characterised by a&#xD;
      pervasive pattern of emotion dysregulation, inconsistent identity, and difficulties with&#xD;
      interpersonal functioning. It is often associated with deliberate self-harm, has a high&#xD;
      burden on affected individuals, family members, and health-care systems, and is associated&#xD;
      with low occupational and educational attainment, lack of long-term relationships, increased&#xD;
      partner conflict, low life satisfaction, and increased statutory service use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, an impaired ability to understand other people's motives and perceptions ('mind&#xD;
      read' or empathise) has been shown to be characteristic of EUPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empathy has two components; cognitive empathy (the ability to imagine someone else's thoughts&#xD;
      and feelings) and emotional empathy (the reciprocal emotional response). People with EUPD&#xD;
      score low on measures of cognitive empathy and high on measures of emotional empathy compared&#xD;
      to non-clinical controls. This suggests that they do not easily understand other peoples'&#xD;
      perspectives, but their own emotions are especially sensitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare services need outcome measures and predictors of treatment response to develop&#xD;
      evidence-based guidelines for EUPD. Hence, this study will use a computer-based empathy&#xD;
      assessment tool and short questionnaires to investigate whether empathy changes during the&#xD;
      course of EUPD, and if the extent of an empathy impairment correlates with syndrome severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the established empathy tests only elicit severe empathy anomalies, produce results&#xD;
      that do not translate into real life scenarios, do not describe cognitive and emotional&#xD;
      empathy separately, or are cumbersome so not routinely applicable. However, the empathy test&#xD;
      this study will use (multifaceted empathy test or MET) has been shown to quantify the EUPD&#xD;
      empathy anomaly, is ecologically valid, does not require training to administer, can be gone&#xD;
      through in 30 minutes in a clinic room, and has NHS IT security clearance. The empathy&#xD;
      questionnaire that will be used (questionnaire of cognitive and affective empathy or QCAE) is&#xD;
      an amalgam of other validated questionnaires which improves on their limitations but is still&#xD;
      concise (31 questions in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MET requires participants to look at several photographs of emotive faces, then choose&#xD;
      the most appropriate adjective. The QCAE asks 31 questions like 'it is hard for me to see why&#xD;
      some things upset people so much'. To ensure that performance is not skewed by reading&#xD;
      ability, participants will be asked to complete the National Adult Reading Test questionnaire&#xD;
      (NART). This only takes a few minutes to complete and is used routinely in NHS clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to join the study when they are diagnosed with EUPD in&#xD;
      consultant psychiatry outpatient appointments. Syndrome severity will be measured with the&#xD;
      Borderline Symptom List 23 (BSL 23) which is self-rated and takes only a few minutes to&#xD;
      complete. Clinical indicators of syndrome severity will be the number of self-harming&#xD;
      episodes per month, the number of hospital assessments per month and the number of hospital&#xD;
      admissions per month. The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS)&#xD;
      will be used to describe any pervasive functional impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-rated Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9&#xD;
      (PHQ-9) will describe any concurrent anxious and depressive symptoms, and the Inventory of&#xD;
      Depressive Symptomatology (Self-Report) (IDS-SR) will describe mood. These also only takes a&#xD;
      few minutes to complete and are used routinely in NHS clinical work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that about 30 participants will be required because similar studies&#xD;
      produced significant results with about that number. Participants will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, after 6 months, 1 year, and 18 months. This should be long enough because the&#xD;
      established psychological therapies for EUPD take about this long.&#xD;
