    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort, multi-site, pilot feasibility&#xD;
      therapeutic trial. The study will enroll 20 patients across 4 cohorts (CRC, gastric, PDAC,&#xD;
      and HCC/intra-hepatic-/extra-hepatic-, gall bladder adenocarcinomas) diagnosed with&#xD;
      histologically confirmed GI cancers. These patients will have already completed all Standard&#xD;
      of Care (SOC) treatments (including neoadjuvant, surgery, local therapies, and/or adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy as applicable), as defined by the treating primary physician or research team, with&#xD;
      curative intent but have a positive SignateraTM tumor-informed ctDNA test and NED&#xD;
      radiographically by standard imaging within 28 days prior to enrollment and within 1 year of&#xD;
      completing all curative-intent therapy. All patients will be treated with intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      atezolizumab 1200 mg IV and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on Day 1 of 21-day cycles until disease&#xD;
      recurrence, ctDNA POD, unacceptable toxicity, or subject withdrawal of consent with a maximum&#xD;
      12 month total duration of study therapy. Atezolizumab and bevacizumab drug will be provided.&#xD;

             treatment strategies are unique to each tumor type and stage but includes all&#xD;
             surgeries and perioperative therapies recommended. If patients were appropriately&#xD;
             treated with curative intent but felt to be high-risk for relapse, they may be still&#xD;
             be included.&#xD;
&#xD;

             treatments) for specific tumor-type and stage per investigator's/primary physician's&#xD;
             or research team's judgment. Curative treatment regimens including chemotherapy,&#xD;
             radiation, treatment sequencing, and surgery should have been followed as per local&#xD;
             standards and NCCN guidelines or non-standard curative-intent therapy through a&#xD;
             clinical trial at the discretion of the investigator/treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have undergone definitive, curative-intent treatment of oligometastatic&#xD;
             (synchronous or metachronous) disease with NED per investigator judgement are&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Negative HIV test at screening, with the following exception: patients with a positive&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Women must not be breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods, and agreement to refrain from&#xD;
             donating eggs as defined below: o Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive&#xD;
             methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at&#xD;
             least 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab and for 6 months after the last&#xD;
             dose of bevacizumab. o Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.&#xD;
             o A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has&#xD;
             not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no&#xD;
             identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of childbearing potential may be&#xD;
             adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;

             below: o With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant, men who&#xD;
             are not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional&#xD;
             contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during&#xD;
             the treatment period and for 6 months after the final dose of bevacizumab. Men must&#xD;
             refrain from donating sperm during this same period. o With a pregnant female partner,&#xD;
             men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 6 months&#xD;
             after the final dose of bevacizumab to avoid exposing the embryo. o The reliability of&#xD;
             sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical&#xD;
             trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,&#xD;
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not&#xD;
             adequate methods of contraception.&#xD;

             finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an&#xD;
             investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the&#xD;
             patient at high risk from treatment complications&#xD;
&#xD;
         30. Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study&#xD;

             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;

             interferon and interleukin 2 [IL-2]) within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug&#xD;
             (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         34. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and&#xD;

             patient has no history of intracranial hemorrhage or spinal cord hemorrhage; - The&#xD;
