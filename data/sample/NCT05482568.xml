  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was an open, multicenter, dose-increasing/investigational Phase IB/II clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the efficacy of SHR-A1811 in combination with other antitumor therapies in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with HER2 . It can be divided into two&#xD;
      parts, Part A is the dose escalation and efficacy exploration study of SHR-A1811 combined&#xD;
      with Pyrotinib, and Part B is the dose escalation and efficacy exploration study of SHR-A1811&#xD;
      combined with SHR-1316.&#xD;
