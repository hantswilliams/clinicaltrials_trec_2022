    <textblock>
      The current study evaluated the Pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction (PK-DDI) of&#xD;
      voriconazole with clarithromycin in healthy male volunteers. The drug interaction study was&#xD;
      designed as a single oral dose, open-label, crossover, and randomized trial. In the first&#xD;
      phase of the study, the principal investigator developed a high-performance-liquid&#xD;
      chromatography (HPLC) method and validation according to standard ICH guidelines for the&#xD;
      quantification of voriconazole in the biological matrix. During the second step, Enrolled&#xD;
      volunteers were divided randomly into group A and group B by the &quot;permuted block&#xD;
      randomization&quot; technique. Then, voriconazole either alone (2 x 200mg, tab, P/O) or in&#xD;
      combination with clarithromycin (Voriconazole 2 x 200mg, tab + clarithromycin 500mg, tab,&#xD;
      P/O) was administered to enrolled volunteers in two sequences. Finally, sample collection was&#xD;
      carried out and blood samples were collected at specified time periods (i.e., 0.0 (pre-dose),&#xD;
      0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12, and 24 hours) in EDTA or heparinized tubes&#xD;
      from the enrolled human volunteers. Further processing of the sample was done for extractions&#xD;
      and subsequent analysis with the developed analytical method.&#xD;

      Study Design and Ethical Approval: The drug interaction study was designed as a single oral&#xD;
      dose, open-label, randomized, cross-over study of healthy volunteers. The ethical approval of&#xD;
      the protocol was taken from the Advanced Studies and Research Board (ASRB) of the Pharmacy&#xD;
      department, Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan before initiation. This study followed the&#xD;
      &quot;ethical principles of the Helsinki declaration for medical research involving human&#xD;
      subjects&quot; and &quot;good clinical practice guidelines&quot;. The clinical trial of this study followed&#xD;
      the guidelines of CONSORT. Written consent was obtained from all included volunteers in the&#xD;
      DDI study. The study was comprised of two treatment sequences with a two-week washout period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Drug administration: Enrolled volunteers were divided randomly into Group A&#xD;
      and Group B by the &quot;permuted block randomization&quot; technique. Computed the volunteer data into&#xD;
      an excel sheet and applied a RAND* function; selected two groups (G-A and G-B) sized, finally&#xD;
      assigned 6 participants in each study group for two (Voriz (alone) or Voriz + CLRM)&#xD;
      intervention arms, for the execution of block randomization. A balance (1:1) was acquired&#xD;
      across both intervention arms through this randomization technique. Treatment drugs were&#xD;
      administered to enrolled volunteers in two sequences,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence-I: In the first phase, group-A volunteers on day-1 received oral voriconazole (2 x&#xD;
      200mg, tab, P/O) while group-B volunteers received oral clarithromycin (500mg, tab, P/O)&#xD;
      along with voriconazole (2 x 200mg, tab, P/O). A two-week wash-out period was allocated that&#xD;
      started on day-2 to day-15 for avoiding the carry-over effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence-II: On day-16, the second phase of the trial was conducted in which group-A&#xD;
      volunteers received voriconazole (2 x 200mg, tab, P/O) along with clarithromycin (500mg, tab,&#xD;
      P/O) while group-B volunteers received Voriz (2 x 200mg, tab, P/O) only. Voriconazole and&#xD;
      clarithromycin were administered to the overnight fasted volunteers corresponding to the&#xD;
      sequences. All volunteers took the medication with a glass of water (250mL). On day-1 and 16&#xD;
      (treatment days), standard breakfast and lunch were served two and six hours after drug&#xD;
      administration to all volunteers, respectively.&#xD;
