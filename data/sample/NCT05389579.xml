      The purpose of this studywas to assess as experimental whether if electric blanket together&#xD;
      withwoolen blanketwere effective in the postoperative period at patients with TKA. The&#xD;
      population of the studywas the TKA patients operated at Kastamonu State Hospital (N=209); the&#xD;
      sample with quota sampling was a total of 46 patients, including 23 selected 23 control&#xD;
      group. Data collection forms for data collection, tympanic thermometer, saturation meter,&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer, woolen blankets and electric blankets were used in research process.The&#xD;
      data collected in this study were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 software. To analyze the data;&#xD;
      descriptive statistics, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, X2, Student's t, Mann-Whitney U test,&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance ANOVA and linear regression analysis were used. According&#xD;
      to the results; it was determined that the use of electric blankets together with woolen&#xD;
      blankets was an efficient method of warming for TKA patients and unheated woolen blanketsare&#xD;
      not sufficient to improve body temperature postoperatively. Studying with large samples and&#xD;
      assessing the effectiveness of warmed woolen blankets with determining the number of warmed&#xD;
      woolen blanket for enhancing the control of hypothermia is suggested.&#xD;

      Methods 2.1. Study Design and Setting As a parallel group, randomized controlled trial with&#xD;
      repeated measures to test the following hypothesis: the average body temperature of patients&#xD;
      who use an electric blanket along with a woolen blanket reaches a normal value at least one&#xD;
      timeframe (15 minutes) before that of patients who use a woolen blanket. It was used electric&#xD;
      blankets for the patients in the experimental group in addition to the routine practices in&#xD;
      the clinic and did the routine practice in the clinic for the patients in the control group&#xD;
      by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in the orthopaedic clinic of a public hospital in Turkey with the&#xD;
      capacity to serve 100.000 patients, where approximately 250 TKA operations are performed per&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Sample Sample of the study included patients who had TKA under spinal and/or epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia. Sample size calculation was performed using the Number Cruncher Statistical&#xD;
      System (NCSS)-Power Analysis and Sample Size (PASS) software. Based on the differences in the&#xD;
      mean scores of body temperatures for seven different times (before surgery, taking to their&#xD;
      beds after surgery, 15th minutes, 30th minutes, 45th minutes, 60th minutes and 75th minutes&#xD;
      after surgery) obtained from the patients in the pilot study, the alpha level was set at 0.05&#xD;
      and power as 80%. Thus, 23 patients were included in each group (23 patients in the&#xD;
      experimental group and 23 patients in the control group). The patients were selected&#xD;
      according to age and gender (each group: male: 4, female: 9 between 60- 69 ages; male: 3,&#xD;
      female: 7 between 70-79 ages) and were randomized according to days of the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Participants and Procedure The inclusion criteria for this study were: being between the&#xD;
      ages of 60 to 79, having an SPO2 value above 90% when they were hospitalized, no having&#xD;
      diseases affecting cognitive functions or thermoregulation due to systemic effects, and no&#xD;
      using any medication which could effect thermoregulation. Additionally, new patients were&#xD;
      selected for the sample in place of patients who wished to withdraw from the study since they&#xD;
      felt uncomfortable by the way the blanket was placed on them or were uncomfortable being&#xD;
      uncovered above their wrists or ankles or lower than the bottom line of the clavicle, or who&#xD;
      needed to remove the blanket completely because of the clinical interventions, or who had to&#xD;
      be taken to the intensive care unit due to the unexpected changes in their general condition.&#xD;
      Four different surgical teams and one single anesthesia team were performed the TKA surgeries&#xD;
      in this hospital. The anesthesia team administered the same anesthetic medication as a spinal&#xD;
      or local combined (spinal and epidural) to all patients in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted between November 1, 2013, and May 1, 2014. The researcher (ED)&#xD;
      informed the nurses in the clinic about the procedures to be done for the experimental and&#xD;
      control groups. The day before the application of this study, the researcher reviewed the&#xD;
      list of the operations to be performed the next day and identified patients who would have&#xD;
      TKA. The researcher also evaluated the fitness of these patients to sample criteria and&#xD;
      patients were informed both verbally and in written form. After obtaining informed consent,&#xD;
      it was measured patients' height and weight, recorded their demographic data, family history,&#xD;
      medical history and the taking medication on a descriptive characteristics information form&#xD;
      (DCIF) by the researcher. The researcher measured the patients' body temperatures in the same&#xD;
      ear in which their body temperatures were measured when they had been hospitalized. The&#xD;
      researcher evaluated whether there were earpieces, infections or external auditory canals for&#xD;
      plugs in deciding in which ear to measure the body temperature. To measure the pulse,&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure and SPO2, it was used the arm that did not have established vascular&#xD;
      access. It was obtained the temperature and humidity of the operating room one hour after&#xD;
      each patient was taken to surgery and recorded this information on the DCIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a woollen blanket used in the clinic was laid on the bed while control group&#xD;
      patients were in the operating room. For experimental group patients, an electric blanket was&#xD;
      placed under the mattress and a wool blanket on the bed sheet while they were in the&#xD;
      operating room. The electric blanket was operated at &quot;hot&quot; level for 20 minutes before the&#xD;
      experimental patient left the operation room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patients were taken to their own beds after surgery, the researcher covered them&#xD;
      with a wool blanket from the top of clavicle to the bottom of their feet, put the&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer on the arm without an IV line, positioned the sphygmomanometer so that the&#xD;
      instrument panel was on the blanket and measured the patients' blood pressure. Then, the&#xD;
      electric blanket was operated at the &quot;warm&quot; level for the experimental group, and it was&#xD;
      turned off and unplugged when their body temperature reached 36.0 Â°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each measuring of vital signs, it was recorded the responses &quot;very little&quot;, &quot;a little&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;very much&quot; as &quot;Yes&quot;, and the responses &quot;no&quot; and &quot;no, I don't&quot; as &quot;No&quot; by asking whether&#xD;
      they felt cold or not. The researcher put the SPO2 probe on the patients' fingers after blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements and counted respiratory rates for one minute while waiting for the SPO2&#xD;
      measurements. During the SPO2 measurement, it was noted if patients did not move, did not&#xD;
      have nail polish, henna or any other paint on their finger on which the measurement was made,&#xD;
      whether the pigmentation of the skin was not different from other body sites, and whether the&#xD;
      measurement site was not colder than other body sites19. To prevent light in the room from&#xD;
      affecting the measurement, the woolen blanket was placed on the patients' hands in a way so&#xD;
      as not to prevent reading the measurement value after the saturation probe was placed on the&#xD;
      finger. The patients' body temperatures were measured in the ear recorded on the DCIF. The&#xD;
      ear was pulled back and entered at a right angle. After this measurement, the researcher&#xD;
      evaluated shivering by observation, and recorded these data on the DCIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, it was read the temperature and humidity in the room on a thermohygrometer and&#xD;
      recorded the measurement on the evaluation form by the researcher. The researcher measured&#xD;
      body temperature, pulse rate, respiration rate, arterial blood pressure, pulse pressure,&#xD;
      oxygen saturation, feeling cold and shivering of experimental and control group before their&#xD;
      surgeries, every 15 minutes after surgeries until being 36 0C of body temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. Measurements To collect the data, a descriptive characteristics information form was&#xD;
      used, which was developed in accordance with the literature (Lundgren et al., 2011, O'Malley&#xD;
      et al., 2012, Pulido et al., 2008). Tools included a tympanic thermometer (Kendall),&#xD;
      saturation measurement device (pulse oximeter), sphygmomanometer (Omron), woolen blanket and&#xD;
      electric blanket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. Analysis The descriptive statistics of the study are presented as means, standard&#xD;
      deviations and frequency and percentages. The presence of a normal distribution was&#xD;
      determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data was evaluated as using the chi-square test to&#xD;
      compare categorical data in contingency tables, the Student's t test for normally distributed&#xD;
      variables in comparing differences between the groups, the Mann-Whitney-U test for variables&#xD;
      not normally distributed, one-way ANOVA for normally distributed variables in the comparison&#xD;
      of more than two groups and Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance when the variable was not&#xD;
      normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Ethical approval This study was approved by a University's Clinical Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee (10/10/2013-16969557-964) in Ankara and, it was obtained permission by Public&#xD;
      Hospitals Association General Secretariat (24/09/2013-91379769/13690). Informed consent was&#xD;
      provided by all participants. All study procedures were conducted in accordance with the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
