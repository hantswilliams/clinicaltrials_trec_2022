    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial of&#xD;
      TQH3821 in adult healthy subjects, which plans to recruit 62 healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose was to evaluate the safety and tolerance of TQH3821 in multiple doses,&#xD;
      single and multiple times in healthy subjects and in combination with methotrexate tablets.&#xD;
