  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both fuel metabolism and circadian rhythms have emerged as important targets to improve&#xD;
      cellular and mitochondrial health and ultimately affect function in older adults. Thus, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to develop minimally invasive measures that will allow us to&#xD;
      accurately assess and detect changes in fuel metabolism and circadian rhythms in older adults&#xD;
      following time-restricted eating.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence indicates the mitochondria have an important role in the&#xD;
      etiologies of many chronic diseases as well as the onset of physical disability in older&#xD;
      adults. Although it is recognized that the mitochondria have an important role in many&#xD;
      functions relevant to healthy aging, the direct assessment of mitochondrial function in&#xD;
      humans is complicated and typically involves a muscle biopsy. Muscle tissue obtained from a&#xD;
      biopsy can be used to provide an index of mitochondrial function, but only at a single time&#xD;
      point. Some individuals may be discouraged from participating in research studies involving&#xD;
      biopsies due to the perceived pain and risk involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why there is a decrease in mitochondrial function with aging remains under debate, but&#xD;
      emerging science indicates that there is a clear connection between mitochondrial biogenesis&#xD;
      and function with fuel metabolism and circadian rhythms. Thus, the purpose of this&#xD;
      development project is to develop relatively non-invasive measures that are sensitive to fuel&#xD;
      metabolism and circadian health which can serve studies conducted within the University of&#xD;
      Florida's Pepper Center in the coming years. In the proposed project, we will investigate the&#xD;
      extent to which our measures of fuel utilization and circadian health markers are time stable&#xD;
      and also sensitive to change following an intervention of time restricted eating, which is&#xD;
      expected to impact these variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no study has assessed fuel utilization patterns or circadian health markers&#xD;
      in overweight older adults. Measurements of altered mitochondrial oxidation with a preference&#xD;
      toward fat metabolism obtained from a blood sample would provide a sensitive biomarker that&#xD;
      is relatively easy to obtain from participants for future interventions studies. The use of&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring may also be used as surrogate measure of adherence to lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions involving calorie restriction and/or intervention fasting, in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to fuel utilization, there is growing recognition that age-related disease&#xD;
      conditions and functional decline are associated with disruption of circadian rhythms. These&#xD;
      observations raise the possibility that targeting circadian rhythms through timing lifestyle&#xD;
      cues, such as meal timing, could be health promoting and may also reduce age associated&#xD;
      declines in mobility. The ability to assess markers of circadian and metabolic health in&#xD;
      minimally invasive ways through temperature and glucose monitoring, will provide potential&#xD;
      valuable measures for explanatory or outcome measures in future studies.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Cellular Fuel Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessing change between Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Fuel preference for mitochondrial energy production of isolated white blood cells (WBC) will be assessed using Agilent/Seahorse technology (XFe96 Flux Analyzer) for high-throughput measurement of mitochondrial oxygen bioenergetic function. We will use the Mito Fuel Flex Test assay (Agilent/Seahorse) to measure basal state mitochondrial fuel oxidation in live cells by using a set of substrates and inhibitors. This assay allows assessing the cell's ability to switch oxidative pathways in meeting basal energetic demands, and the relative contributions of glucose, glutamine and long chain fatty acid oxidation to basal respiration. This is completed by a 12-hour fasting blood draw.</description>

    <description>A &quot;flash glucose monitor/sensor&quot; (CGM; FreeStyle Libre PRO) will be used to assess the changes in 24-hour blood glucose levels. The FreeStyle Libre sensor is easy to apply and wear and can provide every five-minute glucose data to research monitors for up to 14 days. We will replace the CGM approximately every 2 weeks. In this study, we will use the Freestyle PRO thus the participants will be blinded to the data. We will evaluate pattern changes in daily glycemic excursions by week of the study as well as weekly averages and standard deviation by 6-hour time block.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessing change between Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be fitted with a mask and harness and oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production will be measured using a portable Cosmed K5. Participants will be asked to refrain from volitional exercise for the prior 24 hrs and come into the lab after an overnight fast. The mask will be placed over the mouth and nose in a thermoneutral environment. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) will be collected for 45 min and the final 30 min of data will be averaged. Movement or sleeping during the test will be noted, and these time periods will be excluded from RMR calculation using the Weir formula. RMR values will be adjusted for lean mass. Respiratory quotient (RQ) will be calculated as carbon dioxide (CO2) produced divided by oxygen (O2) consumed, protein oxidation during stable evaluation (within a coefficient of variation (CV) &lt;5%). A high RQ closer to 1.0 indicates more carbohydrate production whereas the RQ for fat is 0.7 and for ketones is 0.66 (hypocaloric) to 0.73 (eucaloric).</description>
