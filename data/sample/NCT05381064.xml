  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bile duct scanning system based on deep learning can prompt endoscopists to scan standard&#xD;
      stations and identify bile ducts and stones in real time. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the proposed deep learning-based bile duct scanning&#xD;
      system in improving the diagnostic accuracy of common bile duct stones and reducing the rate&#xD;
      of missed gallstones during bile duct scanning by novice ultrasound endoscopists in a&#xD;
      single-center, tandem, randomized controlled trial&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of gallstones has been increasing in recent years, up to 10-15% in developed&#xD;
      countries, and is still increasing at a rate of 0.6% per year. It is estimated that common&#xD;
      bile duct stones (CBDS) are present in about 10-20% of patients with symptomatic bile duct&#xD;
      stones. Each year, common bile duct stones lead to acute complications such as biliary&#xD;
      obstruction, cholangitis and acute pancreatitis in a large number of patients, seriously&#xD;
      endangering their lives and health. In addition, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) analysis shows&#xD;
      that each episode of common bile duct stones costs $9,000, and acute pancreatitis that&#xD;
      progresses from common bile duct stones can result in 275,000 hospitalizations annually,&#xD;
      incurring $2.6 billion in costs and imposing a significant economic and health burden on&#xD;
      society. Therefore, timely diagnosis of common bile duct stones and intervention for them is&#xD;
      crucial. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the method of choice for&#xD;
      the diagnosis and treatment of CBDS, and guidelines recommend stone extraction for all&#xD;
      patients with CBDS who are physically fit enough to tolerate ERCP operations. However, ERCP&#xD;
      is a highly demanding and risky operation with the potential for serious complications such&#xD;
      as PEP (incidence 2.6-3.5%). How to diagnose choledocholithiasis early and accurately,&#xD;
      achieve timely intervention to improve prognosis, and avoid unnecessary medical operations to&#xD;
      reduce risks are the challenges we are currently trying to solve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guidelines recommend ultrasound endoscopy (EUS) or magnetic resonance&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to determine the presence of CBDS, depending on the local&#xD;
      level of care, for patients in the intermediate-risk group for CBDS and for patients in the&#xD;
      low-risk group whose physicians still have a high suspicion of CBDS. sensitivity. In&#xD;
      addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis showed that MRCP would be the preferred test when the&#xD;
      predicted probability of CBDS is less than 40%, while EUS is the preferred test when the&#xD;
      predicted probability is 40%-90%. Compared to MRCP, EUS has a wide range of applicability but&#xD;
      a steep learning curve. ASGE states that a minimum of 225 EUS operations are required to&#xD;
      qualify, while the ESGE states that a minimum of 300 operations are required. However, this&#xD;
      experience can only be gained at training centers that perform a large number of cases. Thus,&#xD;
      the training of novice physicians in resource-limited areas is a huge challenge, which leaves&#xD;
      a significant shortage of experienced ultrasound endoscopists with poor performance in the&#xD;
      actual diagnosis of common bile duct stones, greatly limiting the popularity of ultrasound&#xD;
      endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the proposed deep&#xD;
      learning-based bile duct scanning system in improving the diagnostic accuracy of common bile&#xD;
      duct stones and reducing the rate of missed gallstones during bile duct scanning by novice&#xD;
      ultrasound endoscopists through a single-center, tandem, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
