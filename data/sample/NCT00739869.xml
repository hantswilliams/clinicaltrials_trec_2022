  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A silent stroke is a type of stroke that does not produce any severe symptoms, but may&#xD;
      slightly affect memory or thinking abilities. Women who take hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
      (HRT) may have a higher risk of experiencing a silent stroke than women who do not use HRT.&#xD;
      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the prevalence of silent&#xD;
      strokes and other changes in brain tissue in women who participated in the Women's Health&#xD;
      Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a study in which women received HRT, either as estrogen&#xD;
      alone or as estrogen and progesterone combined, or placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A silent stroke is a type of stroke that occurs as a result of blockage in the small blood&#xD;
      vessels in the brain. Older adults, in particular, are at risk for silent strokes. This type&#xD;
      of stroke does not cause any of the typical stroke symptoms, such as vision problems, facial&#xD;
      numbness, or walking difficulties; however, subtle changes in a person's cognitive ability or&#xD;
      memory may occur following a silent stroke. It is important to diagnose this type of stroke&#xD;
      because several occurrences of silent strokes can increase the risk of having a more serious,&#xD;
      and possibly fatal, stroke. As women go through menopause, many choose to take HRT to relieve&#xD;
      common menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and mood swings. Unfortunately, the use of&#xD;
      HRT may place women at higher risk of experiencing a silent stroke. This study will assess&#xD;
      whether women who take HRT, either as estrogen alone or as estrogen and progesterone&#xD;
      combined, have a greater risk of silent stroke than women who do not take HRT. Study&#xD;
      researchers will also examine changes in brain tissue and changes in the areas of the brain&#xD;
      associated with thinking and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll women who are participating in the WHIMS study. Participants will&#xD;
      attend one study visit at which time a brain MRI scan will be completed. Study researchers&#xD;
      will analyze participants' study data from the WHIMS study and the Women's Health Initiative&#xD;
      Study of Cognitive Aging (WHISCA) study, an ancillary WHIMS study that examined the effects&#xD;
      of HRT on memory and cognition.&#xD;
