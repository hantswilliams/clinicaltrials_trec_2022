  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASP3082 is a potential new treatment for people with certain solid tumors. Before ASP3082 is&#xD;
      available as a treatment, the researchers need to understand how it is processed by and acts&#xD;
      upon the body. This information will help find a suitable dose and check for potential&#xD;
      medical problems from the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People in this study will be adults with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with&#xD;
      changes in their KRAS gene (G12D mutation). Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other&#xD;
      parts of the body. They will have been previously treated with all available standard&#xD;
      therapies or refused to receive those treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 main aims of this study. The first is to learn if people with certain solid&#xD;
      tumors have any medical problems after receiving different doses of ASP3082, alone or&#xD;
      together with a common cancer drug, cetuximab. Only people with colorectal cancer will&#xD;
      receive ASP3082 and cetuximab. The second aim is to find a suitable dose of ASP3082, alone or&#xD;
      with cetuximab to use in future studies. This study will be in 2 parts. In Part 1, different&#xD;
      small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of ASP3082, alone or with&#xD;
      cetuximab. Any medical problems will be recorded at each dose. This is done to find suitable&#xD;
      doses of ASP3082, alone or with cetuximab to use in Part 2 of the study. The first group will&#xD;
      receive the lowest dose of ASP3082. A medical expert panel will check the results from this&#xD;
      group and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP3082. The panel will do&#xD;
      this for each group until all groups have taken ASP3082 (alone or with cetuximab) or until&#xD;
      suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, other different small groups of people will receive ASP3082, alone or with&#xD;
      cetuximab, with the most suitable doses worked out from Part 1. This will help find a more&#xD;
      accurate dose of ASP3082 to use in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASP3082, and cetuximab (if used), will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion.&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle is 21 days long. They will continue treatment until: they have medical&#xD;
      problems from the treatment; their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; they&#xD;
      ask to stop treatment; they do not come back for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People will visit the clinic on certain days during their treatment, with extra visits during&#xD;
      the first 2 cycles of treatment. During these visits, the study doctors will check for any&#xD;
      medical problems from ASP3082, and/or cetuximab. At some visits, other checks will include a&#xD;
      medical examination, laboratory tests and vital signs. Vital signs include temperature,&#xD;
      pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Also, blood and urine samples will be taken. Tumor&#xD;
      samples will be taken during certain visits during treatment and when treatment has finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People will visit the clinic within 7 days after stopping treatment. The study doctors will&#xD;
      check for any medical problems from ASP3082, and/or cetuximab. Other checks will include a&#xD;
      medical examination, laboratory tests and vital signs. Then, they may visit the clinic at 30&#xD;
      days and 90 days after stopping treatment. At the 30-day visit, the study doctors will check&#xD;
      for any medical problems from ASP3082, and/or cetuximab. People will have their vital signs&#xD;
      checked and have some laboratory tests. At the 90-day visit, the study doctors will check for&#xD;
      any medical problems from ASP3082, and/or cetuximab and people will have their vital signs&#xD;
      checked. After this, people will continue to visit the clinic every 9 weeks. This is to check&#xD;
      the condition of their cancer. They will do this until 45 weeks after treatment stopped,&#xD;
      their cancer is worse, they start other cancer treatment, they ask to stop treatment, or they&#xD;
      do not come back for treatment.&#xD;
